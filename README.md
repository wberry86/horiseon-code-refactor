Horision Code Refactor

Description:

In this project I was required to scan through some prewritten code and then make changes improving the accesibility of the page as well as modifying the CSS code.  Many of the changes to CSS required consolidation of attributes in order to eliminate redundant code saving space.  On the html side, alt captions were added to the images in order to add descriptions for the visually impaired. Some class descriptions were altered in order to simplify the CSS code as well. An example screenshot of the changes to the code will be provided below.
